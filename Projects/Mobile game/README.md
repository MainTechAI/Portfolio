# 4X genre mobile game

The original idea was to develop a mobile game similar to the Sid Meier's Civilization.
The prototype of the game was developed in 2018 using Unity engine and C#.

The [source code](https://mega.nz/folder/eLgCADrZ#Yy05yfPTR7PPtRX_Vj66pQ) of the game is stored on my Mega cloud.
