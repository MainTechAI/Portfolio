### Training



The training/testing data were collected from the internet, some were manually uploaded, 
and some were automatically parsed from search engine results. In total there are 
11100 images of different sizes.

These images were manually labeled using [OpenLabeling](https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling/) tool.
It was chosen for labeling because it supports the required annotation formats (PASCAL VOC, YOLO darknet).
