# Chemical toxicity prediction

The goal was to test different machine learning approaches for assessing the toxicity of a chemical by predicting its approximate LD50 value. The input data is a chemical encoded in SMILES format. Several machine learning and deep learning models were tested. 

The project was made in 2020. It serves more as a proof-of-concept.
